The following may help guide you while adding or editing reports. If there is anything you are not sure about, just ask.



### General

Please try to be sensitive. Everyone we write about was a real person and not a statistic. If in doubt, hold back.

In particular, it is often not possible to unambiguously confirm a victim's gender identify. If in any doubt, use gender neutral pronouns and write the entry accordingly.



### Naming and deadnaming

The names of victims are not always reported accurately, so please be careful.

Avoid deadnaming, and if you can determine the victim's preferred social name, use that. Otherwise, abbreviate gendered firstnames appropriately, e.g. ("F. J. Brito").



### Location fields

The location field usually includes the city/municipality and state/province/department (the terminology varies from country to country) - for example "Manaus, Amazonas".

Where the city and state are the same, just enter it once - e.g. avoid "São Paulo, São Paulo".

The site can determine approximate map coordinates from the location, but if you have more accurate coordinates (e.g. from a specific location obtained via Google Maps) you can enter it manually.



### Description

Description text can be written in plain text or Markdown (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). The "Edit/Preview with StackEdit" link launches a WYSIWYG marksdown editor.

The first line of the description is used to populate the corresponding memorial card. There is a length limit on this field, so check the "Memorial Card Short Description:" text (below the description field) to see how it will come out.

Include quotes from source materials as appropriate. Annotate any corrections to source quotes in square brackets ("[]"), for example when correcting pronouns or deadnames, or adding additional info.

Please vear in mind that machine translation engines (e.g. Google translate) can randomly change pronouns in the output text, so in such cases don't worry about marking pronoun corrections with "[]" as above.



### Photos

Photos should be in .jpg format, resized to (typically) between 960 and 1200 px wide and ideally no more than 300kB in size.

Please feel free to crop and post-process any photos you find as appropriate.

Don't forget to include details of the source of the photo (a URL if possible, but plain text is also OK). 



### Other considerations

New reports will be saved as drafts initially, and will not be publicly visible unless the URL is shared.

** If editing a published report, remember that any changes you make will become visible immediately.**
