<p>This site is intended to serve as a companion resource for <a href="https://tdor.info/about-2/" target="_blank"><b>Transgender Day of Remembrance</b></a> (TDoR) events.</p>

<p>The idea is to bring together what we know about all of those we have lost so that others can understand who they were and what happened to them. Although we often know very little, what we do know is absolutely heartbreaking - but we owe it to those we have lost to do at least that.</p>

<p>The idea for the site came about as a result of the TDoR 2017 vigil in Bournemouth, United Kingdom - see <a href="https://medium.com/@annajayne/remembering-our-dead-never-gets-any-easier-befb5d7ee7cc" target="_blank"><b>Remembering Our Dead Never Gets Any Easier</b></a> (though be warned: this blogpost is extremely hard to read).</p>

<p>Subsequently, what we learned about each of the victims was written up in a series of blogposts (one per month) starting at <a href="https://medium.com/@annajayne/tdor-2017-say-their-names-learn-their-stories-remember-them-b81d50fd8ef" target="_blank"><b>TDoR 2017: Say their names. Learn their stories. Remember them</b></a>.</p>

<p>Although <a href="https://medium.com/@annajayne/tdor-2018-say-their-names-read-their-stories-remember-them-2ccdccc9db1a" target="_blank">a similar series of blogposts</a> have been written for TDoR 2018, the aim has always been to develop a dedicated site for this purpose.</p>

<p>This site aims to do just that. Eventually data for earlier years will also be added, along with exports of data and other resources that others can use during TDoR memorial events. If you would like to collaborate to help us to develop things further, please contact us via <a href="mailto:tdor@translivesmatter.info">email</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tdorinfo" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1570448163283501/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</p>

<p>But we must never forget that all of this is just a means to an end - an end to transphobic violence and everything that stems from it. We'd also be remiss if we didn't say thank you to all of the activists worldwide who are working to shine a light on the horror and make sure that those we have lost are not forgotten.</p>

<p>We hope that one day things will change for the better and a site like this will no longer be needed.</p>
