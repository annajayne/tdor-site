<p>This site is intended to serve as a companion resource for <a href="https://tdor.info/about-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Transgender Day of Remembrance</b></a> (TDoR) events.</p>

<p>The idea is to bring together what we know about all of those we have lost so that others can understand who they were and what happened to them. Although we often know very little, what we do know is absolutely heartbreaking - but we owe it to all of those we have lost to do at least that.</p>

<p>The idea for the site came about as a result of the TDoR 2017 vigil in Bournemouth, United Kingdom - see <a href="https://medium.com/@annajayne/remembering-our-dead-never-gets-any-easier-befb5d7ee7cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Remembering Our Dead Never Gets Any Easier</b></a> (though be warned: this blogpost is extremely hard to read).</p>

<p>Subsequently, what we learned about each of the victims was written up in a series of blogposts (one per month) starting at <a href="https://medium.com/@annajayne/tdor-2017-say-their-names-learn-their-stories-remember-them-b81d50fd8ef" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>TDoR 2017: Say their names. Learn their stories. Remember them</b></a>.</p>

<p>Although <a href="https://medium.com/@annajayne/tdor-2018-say-their-names-read-their-stories-remember-them-2ccdccc9db1a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a similar series of blogposts</a> were written for TDoR 2018, the aim was always to develop a dedicated site for this purpose instead.</p>

<p>This site aims to be just that. Since then data for earlier years has also been added, along with resources that can be used during TDoR memorial events and the ability to export all of the data included here. If you would like to collaborate to help us to develop things further, <b>please contact us</b>, either by <a href='/pages/contact' rel='nofollow'>email</a> or via <a href="https://twitter.com/TDoRinfo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>. Links to relevant news reports can also be posted to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1570448163283501/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trans Violence News</a> on Facebook.</i></p>

<p>But we must never forget that all of this is just a means to an end - that end being an end to transphobic violence and everything that stems from it. We'd also be remiss if we didn't say thank you to all of the activists worldwide who are working to shine a light on the horror and make sure that those we have lost are not forgotten.</p>

<p>We hope that one day things will change for the better and a site like this will no longer be needed.</p>
