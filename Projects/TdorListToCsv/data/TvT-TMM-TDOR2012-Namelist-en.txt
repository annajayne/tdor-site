                              had sex with her.

Remarks:                     A number of social organizations have expressed concern about the  
                             negligence of the authorities in the investigation of the killing, based  
                             on their assumption that it might be a crime of passion. The Inter- 
                             American Commission on Human Rights condemned the murder and  
                             reminded the State of its obligation to investigate such acts on its own  
                             initiative and to punish those responsible.
