Cause of Death:               Stabbed to death  
Remarks:                      The  victim  was  a  migrant,  working  in  the  sex  industry.  In  January  
                              2009,  the  perpetrator  --  a  19-year-old  man  --  was  brought  to  court.  
                              The perpetrator stabbed his victim 39 times with a 30cm-long knife.  
                              When  he  saw  that  his  victim  was  still  moving,  the  perpetrator  
                              smashed the head of the victim with a video recorder. The judge at  
                              the  Hamburg  court  referred  to  the  perpetrator’s  "absolute  desire  to  
                              exterminate"  and  described  the  murder  as  “extremely  brutal,”  but  
                              declared  there  was  “no  motive.”  The  perpetrator  was  sentenced  to  
                              seven years for manslaughter.

Remarks:                      Victim was shot to death with two shots: one in the head and another  
                              in the back. She worked as a waitress in a bar in the “red light  
                              district”. The police have ruled out theft as a motive because none of  
                              the victim’s possessions were missing.
