Cause of Death:                 stabbed and strangled  
Remarks:                        The victim was worried about her safety in the weeks leading up to the  
                                homicide, because she was sexually aussaulted. The murderer was a  
                                man the victim met online and started to date for a short time. The  
                                murderer confessed that he "dispatched" Bates by strangling her with  
                                his hands. He allegedly moved her body to the floor and saw it "jump."  
                                He told police he did not want her to "come back," so he took a folding  
                                knife from a hutch and stabbed Bates several times, according to the  
                                charges.  Bates' cause of death was complex homicidal violence, with  
                                four stab wounds to the torso and one to the left side of the neck. The  
                                victim also had broken ribs, and the hyoid bone in her throat was  
                                loosened, a sign of strangulation.
