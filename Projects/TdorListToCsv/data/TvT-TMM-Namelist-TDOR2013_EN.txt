Date of Death:                     28/12/12  

Location of Death:                 Visakhapatnam (India)  

Cause of Death:                    tortured  

Remarks:                           The victim was in police custody and was brought to a hospital, where she died.  

                                   Civil liberties organizations alleged that the victim died after she was tortured  

                                   by the police and have demanded a judicial inquiry. Police authorities made  

                                   wild allegations against the deceased in a bid to discredit him and hush up the  

                                   case. They argued that the victim was 'a vagabond after he lost his parents  

                                   when he was a teenager and had even become a eunuch.' Newspapers reported,  

                                   that this takes the total count of custodial deaths in the police station to four in  

                                   the last two years.

Location of Death:                 Georgetown (Guyana)  

Cause of Death:                    slit throat  

Remarks:                           The victim was a sex worker and was murdered by three men. The police  

                                   arrested three suspects. A relative said that the victim knew her murderes and  

                                   that they had sex with her, before murdering her. Activists from the NGO  

                                   Society Against Sexual Orientation Discrimination (SASOD) noted that  violence  

                                   against transgender sex workers is way too common in Guyana, underscoring  

                                   that many incidents go unreported because the victims fear that no action will  

                                   be taken against the perpetrators  and added “laws which criminalise crossH 

                                   dressing and sameHsex intimacy provide institutional validation for the  

                                   prejudices which fuel violence against sexual and gender minorities.”
